                                Enhanced an existing binary analysis tool by adding support for 64-bit systems using LLVM Intermediate Representation (IR). This involved extending functionalities within Ghidra through a combination of Python scripting and C++ development. The project improved compatibility and analysis precision for modern architectures, enabling more effective reverse engineering and binary lifting workflows.

                                Designed and developed an Android application to serve as sort of a prototype to demonstrate real-time parcel tracking functionality. The app showcases live tracking features and enhance user experience. This project involved integrating tracking APIs, designing intuitive UI components, and implementing background services to update parcel status in real time.
                                Moreover, helped in removing some major security flaws with some existing works.

                                This paper examines the security landscape of SDN, analyzing how traditional network security issues translate to SDN environments. It highlights common vulnerabilities and discusses mitigation strategies, emphasizing that while SDN offers architectural advantages, security remains a critical and complex concern. The study aims to raise awareness and foster deeper consideration of SDN-specific security risks.
