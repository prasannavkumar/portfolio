                                With the rise in the amount of sensitive data that is being exchanged and stored across
                                different platforms, the security of such sensitive data has become a critical concern in modern application development.
                                Cryptographic APIs are a way to enable developers to add security measures to their applications without 
                                having to understand the working of the cryptographic details of those APIs. This is an essential way in which we modernize development processes.
                                Not every concept is needed to be understood in order to work with them. However, Cryptographic APIs are often seen to cause numerous vulnerabilities in 
                                applications due to improper usage.  The paper investigates the root causes of such misuse and explores how proper requirements engineering
                                can be used in order to guide the development of a framework that can mitigate these issues. Key research questions that we deal with in this paper include identifying threats posed by incorrect
                                API usage, defining correct behavior, distinguishing whether vulnerabilities arise from poor design or improper use and specifying requirements that we need to consider
                                when building a framework to deal with this issue. We present a structured approach to enhancing security through improved
                                requirements engineering for Cryptographic APIs.
                                The focus of this paper is on how better engineering practices at the API design and specification level can 
                                help avoid the ability of a developer to misuse the APIs because inherently the purpose of APIs is to allow
                                someone without the understanding of inner working to be able to work with the APIs.

                                This project examines the pervasive issue of Cryptographic API misuse through a data-driven lens. We focus on 
                                what data we have available from both static and dynamic analysis tools taking a look at various tools like Cryptolint (a lightweight static
                                analysis tool) but also consider the perspective that benchmarking tools may not be very useful when it comes to Cryptographic rules because 
                                they can change as the existing rules are broken and new ones are made. A look at various data sources and analyzing it does potray a clear picture
                                that this issue is worth looking at and more prevalent than one would think. Therefore, using both existing data and finding patterns, we need to work
                                to work on building a robust framework that can be extended and modified.
                                The focus here is to identify trends using data that we have available in order to understand both the importance
                                of the issue we are discussing as well inform the reader on how we can leverage the existing data in order to better detection tools.

                               Survey paper exploring security challenges in Software Defined Networking (SDN) done as part of Advanced Network Technology Course. 
                               This work builds on a prior collaborative project (see below) that focused on mitigation techniques, while the focus of this paper is to highlight 
                               and deep dive into a survey of the current landscape of SDN security. Both the papers aim to analyze how traditional network security issues translate to SDN environments. But this paper highlights common vulnerabilities to emphasize that while SDN offers architectural advantages, we need to remember that even with those advantages security continues to be a critical and complex concern. The study aims to raise awareness and foster deeper consideration of SDN-specific security risks.

                            It investigates root causes, the influence of project popularity and contributor diversity on bug occurrence and fix time, and patterns of bug location within source files.
                             Python tools and data mining techniques were applied to gain insights that could improve automated program repair approaches for such bugs.
                             We did this as part of a software engineering course. </div>
