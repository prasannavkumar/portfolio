                    <p>
                        Welcome to the lighter side! This page is all about what makes me tick beyond software and specs. From my favorite games and books to the music that keeps me going and my obsession with mechanical keyboards and PC parts— here is a peek at my passions and hobbies. No code here, just the things I love and the stories that shape who I am.
 Whether you are a fellow gamer, a music lover, or just curious about what I do when I am not coding, you are in the right place!

        <p  class="showcase_description">
            Rocket League is my favorite game of all time. While being a competitive gamer has always been a core
            part of my personality, rocket league doesn't just hit my need for competitive environment which it does provide in spades but it also makes me realize
            the importance of team work. I have sunk over 1000 hours in this game and honestly, I feel like I have barely scratched the surface of what this game has to offer
            and there is so much more to learn and improve at. If there is any game that makes me feel like esports has a real place in gaming, it is this masterpiece.

            While competitive games are fun, a lot of times after studying all day, you just want to relax and for me, driving around in Los Santos is that perfect after work relaxing time activity. From the amazing recreation of various LA sights to insanely fun story mode and multiplayer world, GTA V has both captured me and englufed me in its world. 
        GTA Vice City (and RE4) was essentially the game that made me realize that I love games. It might be a leading reason of why I got into Computers in the first place. Making something like that was like my childhood dream. And while I moved away from playing games as much as I used to as life got busy, I have always found comfort in GTA's beautiful storytelling and world aross the titles. And GTA V is to me, just the latest one and well, the multiplayer just made it 10x better.  </p>

            Easily my favorite novels of all time. While I have read a lot of books over the past 20 or so years, somehow, this series has never left the special spot it hold in my heart.
        I used to be adamant that Harry Potter is the best series I have read and objectively, it might be but something about the way this book mixes reality with fiction, gods with mortals, special with the ordinary and adventure with humor : it just feels "home".       </p>

            I can't describe how much I love this franchise. From the novels to the movies, from the merch to the fantastic video games (especially Hogwarts Legacy), from the beautiful world that the series gave us to dream about to the iconic : "You are a wizard, Harry" : this 
            franchise has and will always be : the best work of fiction to me.
